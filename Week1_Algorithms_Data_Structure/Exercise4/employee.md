# Array

Arrays are a fundamental data structure that allows you to store a collection of elements. This section will cover how arrays are represented in memory and discuss their advantages.
- **Contiguous Block:** Arrays are stored in a continuous block of memory. This means that all elements are placed sequentially in memory, which facilitates efficient access.
- **Index-Based Access:** Each element in an array can be accessed directly using its index. This provides constant-time access (O(1)) to any element, making retrieval very fast.

## Advantages

- **Fast Access:** Direct indexing allows for quick access to elements within the array.
- **Simplicity:** Arrays are easy to implement and use, providing a straightforward approach to storing and managing collections of data.
- **Low Overhead:** Arrays have minimal overhead compared to more complex data structures, such as linked lists or hash tables, making them efficient for certain use cases.



## Complexity
### Addition (`addEmployee`)

- **Time Complexity:** O(1)
- **Explanation:** Adding an employee involves placing the employee at the next available position in the array and incrementing the size counter. This operation is constant time because it does not depend on the number of elements in the array.

### Search (`searchEmployee`)

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Explanation:** Searching for an employee requires a linear scan through the array to find the employee with the matching `employeeId`. In the worst case, this involves checking all elements, hence the time complexity is linear.

### Traverse (`traverseEmployees`)

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Explanation:** Traversi+ng the array involves visiting each element once to print or process it. Therefore, the time complexity is proportional to the number of employees, which is linear.

### Delete (`deleteEmployee`)

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Explanation:** Deleting an employee requires:
  - Finding the index of the employee (which is O(n)).
  - Shifting all elements after the deleted employee one position to the left (which is also O(n) in the worst case).
  - The overall complexity is dominated by the linear scan and shifting operations, resulting in O(n).

## Limitations

1. **Fixed Size:**
   - Once an array is created, its size cannot be changed. If the number of employees exceeds the initial capacity, you cannot directly add more elements without creating a new, larger array and copying the existing elements over.

2. **Inefficient Insertions and Deletions:**
   - Inserting or deleting elements requires shifting elements to maintain a contiguous block. This can be inefficient, especially for large arrays, as both operations have O(n) complexity in the worst case.

3. **Memory Wastage:**
   - If the array is initialized with a capacity much larger than the number of elements, it can lead to wasted memory. Conversely, if the array is too small, frequent resizing and copying are needed.

4. **No Built-in Methods for Dynamic Resizing:**
   - Unlike some data structures, arrays do not support dynamic resizing. To handle resizing, you need to manually create a new array and copy elements, which adds complexity.

## When to Use Arrays

1. **Known and Fixed Size:**
   - Use arrays when you know the maximum number of elements in advance and this number does not change often. For example, if the employee count is stable and known beforehand, arrays can be efficient.

2. **Fast Index-Based Access:**
   - Arrays are ideal when you need fast access to elements via indices. They provide constant-time access, making them suitable for applications requiring quick lookups.

3. **Low Overhead:**
   - Arrays have low overhead compared to more complex data structures. When memory efficiency is crucial and dynamic resizing is not needed, arrays are a good choice.

4. **Simple Data Management:**
   - Arrays are suitable for simple scenarios where the data structure does not require frequent modifications or dynamic size changes.
